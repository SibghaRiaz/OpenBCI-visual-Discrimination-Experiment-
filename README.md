# OpenBCI-visual-Discrimination-Experiment-
The dataset that is used in it is produced by using openBCI. OpenBCI is used to measure and record the electrical activity produced by the brain EEG signal. In this first remove the DC offset after that notch filter is used to remove the fixed frequency noise source present init.
Two models are used to find the accuracy score of the dataset which is following LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier.
